            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Treatiſe made by Athanaſius the Great, <hi>concerning the vſe and vertue of</hi> the Pſalmes.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ALl holy Scripture is certainly the teacher of all vertue, and of the true faith: but the booke of the pſalmes doth expreſſe after a certaine manner the very ſtate and condition of the ſoule. For as he which intendeth to preſent himſelfe to a King will firſt compound himſelfe to ſet in good order both his geſture and his ſpeech, leſt als hee might be reputed rude and ignorant: euen ſo doth this godly booke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all ſuch as be deſirous to lead their life in vertue, and to know the life of our Sauiour, which he led in his conuerſation, putting them in mind in the reading thereof, of all their affections and paſſions wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoule is inclined.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moreouer, the pſalmes informe and teach euery man with diuers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, whereby he may not onely ſpy the affections and ſtate of his ſoule, and to winne a good paterne and diſcipline how hee may pleaſe God, but alſo with what forme of words he may amend himſelfe, and how to giue God thanks, leaſt if he ſhould ſpeake otherwiſe then were conuenient, he should fall into impiety by his vnreuerent eſtimation of God: for wee must all make account to the Iudge, as well of our idle words as our ill deſerts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF therefore thou wouldeſt at any time deſcribe a bleſſed man who he is, and what thing maketh him to be ſo, thou haſt the 1.32.41.112.128. Pſalmes.</p>
